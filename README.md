<br>

A simple text editor. Does things like GNU ed.<br>

## Why uxed?
In the beginning, I just wrote a text-editor for uinxed-kernel.<br>
Then I made it a bit like GNU ed...<br>
And it works! I decided to write it like GNU ed.<br>
<br>
Uxed is more small, quickly, portable than GNU ed. And it can do things well.<br>
And you can learn uxed very fast as long as you had used ed before.<br>
